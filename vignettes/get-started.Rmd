<!-- WARNING - This vignette is generated by {fusen} from dev/flat_first.Rmd: do not edit by hand -->


<!-- Run this 'development' chunk -->
<!-- Store every call to library() that you need to explore your functions -->

<!--
 You need to run the 'description' chunk in the '0-dev_history.Rmd' file before continuing your code there.

If it is the first time you use {fusen}, after 'description', you can directly run the last chunk of the present file with inflate() inside.

# Include some data examples in your package

<!-- 
 Store your dataset in a directory named "inst/" at the root of your project.
 Use it for your tests in this Rmd thanks to `pkgload::load_all()` to make it available
and `system.file()` to read it in your examples.

- There already is a dataset in the "inst/" directory to be used in the examples below
-->


# Occurrences

```{r examples-Occurrences}
Occurrences(c(2,3),rbind(c(1,2),c(2,3),c(2,3),c(7,8)))

# Example with your dataset in "inst/"
datafile=system.file("M64.RData",package="grouptheory")
load(datafile)
# Apply my function
Occurrences(c(1,2,4,8,16,32,7,1,1),M64)
```



# Smallest

```{r examples-Smallest}
Smallest(rbind(c(1,2),c(2,3),c(2,3),c(7,8)))

# Example with your dataset in "inst/"
datafile=system.file("M64.RData",package="grouptheory")
load(datafile)
# Apply my function
Smallest(M64)
```



# FindRows

```{r examples-FindRows}
FindRows(c(2,3,5),rbind(c(1,2,7),c(2,3,5),c(2,3,-10),c(7,8,5)))

# Example with your dataset in "inst/"

<!--
# There can be development actions

Create a chunk with 'development' actions

- The chunk needs to be named `development` or `dev`
- It contains functions that are used for package development only
- Note that you may want to store most of these functions in the 0-dev_history.Rmd file

These are only included in the present flat template file, their content will not be part of the package anywhere else.
-->


# Inflate your package

You're one inflate from paper to box.
Build your package from this very Rmd using `fusen::inflate()`

- Verify your `"DESCRIPTION"` file has been updated
- Verify your function is in `"R/"` directory
- Verify your test is in `"tests/testthat/"` directory
- Verify this Rmd appears in `"vignettes/"` directory
